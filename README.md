## Predictive Analysis for Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Success: Implications for Competitive Rocket Launch Bidding

## Overview

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the capstone project focused on constructing a predictive model for determining the probability of a successful landing for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. In today's competitive space industry, SpaceX has emerged as a frontrunner by offering Falcon 9 rocket launches at an unprecedented cost of 62 million dollars, a significant reduction compared to other providers whose launch expenses can surpass 165 million dollars due to the lack of first stage reusability.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust predictive system that accurately forecasts the probability of a successful landing for the Falcon 9 first stage. The pivotal aspect lies in establishing a direct connection between the prediction of successful landings and the subsequent accurate estimation of launch costs. Such predictive capabilities bear substantial weight in competitive scenarios, notably for spaceY, a hypothetical company aspiring to rival SpaceX's position in the rocket launch market.

## Key Components

### 1. Predictive Modeling

The project centers around creating a predictive model utilizing historical data related to Falcon 9 rocket launches. This model aims to determine the likelihood of successful landings based on various factors and conditions associated with each launch.

### 2. Cost Estimation

By leveraging the predictive model's outcomes, this project intends to provide critical insights into cost estimations for rocket launches. Accurate estimation of launch costs based on the likelihood of Falcon 9's first stage landing success is vital for strategic planning and competitive positioning.

### 3. Documentation and Codebase

The repository encompasses comprehensive documentation, methodologies, and findings housed in the `docs` directory. Additionally, the `src` directory contains the codebase, comprising Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or any relevant code files.
